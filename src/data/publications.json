    "description": "This study compares deep learning–based image processing techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection in offshore wind turbines (OWTs). It investigates three signal-to-image encoding algorithms—Gramian Angular Summation Field, Gramian Angular Difference Field, and Markov Transition Field—to transform time-series data into image-like representations. The results demonstrate that encoding choice strongly affects anomaly detection performance, highlighting the value of image-like data representations in deep learning frameworks for industrial monitoring.",

    "description": "This paper introduces a signal-to-image conversion approach integrated with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for detecting anomalies in wind turbine gearbox systems. The study evaluates six conversion algorithms that transform time-series data into image-like formats for anomaly detection. Results show that Gramian Angular Field–based encodings significantly enhance model accuracy, paving the way for affordable and automated wind turbine monitoring systems.",
